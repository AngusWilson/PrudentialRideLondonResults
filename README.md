# PrudentialRideLondonResults

The Prudential Ride london does not publish results in time, or position order. Reason being is to discourage racing or dangerous cycling in favour of achieving a finish position.

However, the results are searchable via https://results.prudentialridelondon.co.uk/2019/

As I competed in the 100 mile I wanted to see how I stacked up.

The repo contains a simple q script, which downloads each results page (via curl), picks out the html fields into a q table, and adds rankings.

Also contains the output csv.
